# hello-world
My first repositary
Hi, I am Raajesh. I am here created my GitHub account to submit my assignments while doing my Udacity Nanodegree course. This is my first edit. I have created one repositary called hello-world and then i have created one branch name readme-edits to my master branch. my readme-edits branch is just a copy of my default master branch. Now am doing some changes in README.md file which is in my readme-edits branch. Hence my readme-edits branch will not be the same as such my default master branch after this commit. Thank you.
